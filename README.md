# JIL Adapter For DAG Engine

## What ? ---- JIL for Autosys and DAG for Airflow: Workflow Management in Action

This document explores the concepts of JIL for Autosys and DAG for Airflow, highlighting their role in workflow management.

### JIL for Autosys

JIL (Job Intermediate Language) is a powerful scripting language used within **Autosys**, a job scheduling and workload automation solution. 

**Key Features of JIL for Autosys:**

* **Job Definition:** JIL scripts define jobs and their dependencies, enabling complex workflows. 
* **Scheduling:** JIL allows for precise scheduling of jobs, specifying time intervals, dependencies, and triggers.
* **Resource Management:** JIL facilitates the allocation and management of system resources for job execution.
* **Monitoring and Alerting:** JIL enables monitoring of job status and triggering alerts based on specific conditions.
* **Workflow Orchestration:** JIL scripts can be chained together, enabling complex workflows with dependencies and conditional execution.

**Example JIL script for Autosys:**

```
# Define a job named "DataCleaning"
job DataCleaning {
    # Specify the command to execute
    command "/usr/bin/python3 /path/to/cleaning_script.py"
    # Schedule the job to run daily at 3:00 AM
    schedule "0 3 * * *"
    # Define dependencies on other jobs
    depend_on "DataIngestion"
}
```

### DAG for Airflow

DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is a fundamental concept within **Airflow**, an open-source platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows.

**Key Features of DAGs in Airflow:**

* **Workflow Visualization:** DAGs provide a clear visual representation of workflow structure, dependencies, and execution flow.
* **Task Definition:** Each node in a DAG represents a task, defining specific operations or scripts to be executed.
* **Dependency Management:** Edges in a DAG represent dependencies between tasks, ensuring tasks run in the correct order.
* **Scheduling and Triggering:** Airflow provides flexible scheduling options, allowing for timed execution, trigger-based execution, and more.
* **Monitoring and Logging:** Airflow offers comprehensive monitoring features, logging task execution details and providing alerts for failures.

**Example DAG definition in Python (Airflow):**

```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.bash import BashOperator
from datetime import datetime

with DAG(
    dag_id='data_pipeline',
    schedule_interval='@daily',
    start_date=datetime(2023, 12, 27),
    catchup=False
) as dag:

    # Define the tasks
    extract_data = BashOperator(task_id='extract_data', bash_command='python extract_data.py')
    transform_data = BashOperator(task_id='transform_data', bash_command='python transform_data.py')
    load_data = BashOperator(task_id='load_data', bash_command='python load_data.py')

    # Define the task dependencies
    extract_data >> transform_data >> load_data
```

### JIL vs. DAG: Similarities and Differences

Both JIL for Autosys and DAG for Airflow are used to define and manage workflows. However, there are key differences:

* **JIL:**  Is a scripting language, focusing on defining jobs and their dependencies. It's integrated within Autosys's scheduler and management framework.
* **DAG:** Is a visual and programmatic representation of a workflow, designed to be highly flexible and extensible. It's part of a dedicated platform (Airflow) that handles scheduling, monitoring, and more.


  

## Want to move out from Autosys  due to high licence cost (More than a billion $ market ) ? A Case for Open Source Workflow Management
